# Final-project-from-Icy-Stephanie-and-Aiden

This is the final website project for the Website Localization Course-MIIS. 
Group members: Ting Lin, Man Li and Qunpeng Qiao.

This project is to create a webpage about Monterey in English and to localize it into Chinese so that both English and Chinese students or travellers can benefit from the website before coming to Monterey.

The webpage has five tabs, including "Home", "Food", "Shopping", "Travel" and "About", from which viewers can gather basic information and get a general understanding of Monterey. The "Chinese" file includes the Chinese version of the webpage.

Major development steps include webpage design, webpage creation, testing, localization (pseudo, DTP and text translation), localzation testing and delivery.

No additional setup is required to view the webpage.

Enjoy!
